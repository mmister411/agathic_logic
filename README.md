# Agathic Logic

Agathic Logic is a a formal logic system for representing ethical propositions based on biblical teachings and rules.  In some ways, it is similar to deontic logic along with alethic logic, but its main focus is on well-formed formulas that deal with ethical values instead of just obligations or possibility and necessity.  Agathic logic builds on the idea that some actions or behaviors have inherent ethical value and can be mapped onto a square, hexagon, or even octagon of opposition due to the spectrum-like nature of Good to not good, giving a complete framework for making ethical decisions.  

Depending on the situation, this system looks at how good to fruitful or vain to abominable an action or behavior is in terms of scripture, time and eternity.  Agathic Logic's six ethical concepts are Fruitful, Good, Righteous, Vain, Sinful, and Abominable.  Each concept is defined and supported by specific biblical passages and is represented on the hexagon of opposition by a distinct symbol and value.

Because Agathic Logic recognizes that ethical decision-making is complex and multifaceted, it provides several ethical concepts to help people navigate various situations and scenarios.  It also emphasizes the interconnectedness of the ideas and the importance of considering their implications and exceptions.  Agathic Logic is designed to promote virtuous behavior and encourage individuals to live out their faith in practical and meaningful ways by providing a systematic and biblically-based approach to ethics and logic.

## Axioms:

Tautology: Any statement is either true or false with respect to the given value system.
Necessitation: If a statement is true, then it is necessarily true with respect to the given value system.
Possibility: Any statement is possibly true or possibly false with respect to the given value system.
Distribution: Necessarily, if a statement A implies a statement B, then necessarily A implies necessarily B with respect to the given value system.
Reflexivity: Any statement is necessarily true of itself with respect to the given value system.
Transitivity: If A is necessarily true and A implies B, then B is necessarily true with respect to the given value system.
Non-Contradiction: No statement can be both true and false with respect to the given value system.
Excluded Middle: Every statement is either true or false with respect to the given value system.
Ought Implies Can: If something is good to do, then it is possible to do it.
